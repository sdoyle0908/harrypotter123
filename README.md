# Date Night Done Right

>[Date Night Done Right](url) is an app we created that answers the age old question of "what do we do tonight"

### This app will allow you to choose if you are:
- Staying In or
- Going Out

### Then you will be presented with the options of:
- Doing something romantic themed or
- Staying casual

After you choose your basic parameters, you will be given options for a drink mix, some music to listen to, a list of nearby restaurants/take-out, things to do nearby, or a recipe to cook at home

```
### Built With
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* Bulma CSS Frameworks
* Spotify API
* Cocktails API
* Yelp API
* Spoonacular API
* A lot of love, snark, and coffee
```
